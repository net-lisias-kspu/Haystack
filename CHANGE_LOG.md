# Haystack :: Change Log

* 2014-0818: 0.3.1.1 (qberticus) for KSP 0.24.2
	+ Fixed a bug where the display would break as debris left physics range and was removed by the game.
	+ Resizing the window should be smoother in low FPS situations.
* 2014-0811: 0.3.1.0 (qberticus) for KSP 0.24.2
	+ You can now display a list of docking ports for the nearby ships (i.e., loaded in physics range) and target them. The list only displays available docking ports (i.e., the docking port must not have a ship docked and must have a free attach node)
	+ The docking port list includes support for the Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod's named port feature. If it detects this mode it will use the name of the docking port that has been set in the display. If the mod is not detected it will default to using the name of the part.
	+ Ship list now displays the distance that ship is from the active ship.
	+ The Haystack Continued window will now show display in regular flight mode and in map mode
* 2014-0808: 0.3.0.0 (qberticus) for KSP 0.24.2
	+ Vessels can now be grouped by the celestial body that they are orbiting
	+ Window is also provided in the Tracking Center
	+ Window is now resizable to compliment its ability to be dragged
* 2013-1115: 0.2.2.1 (enamelizer) for KSP 0.22
	+ Allow the UI in flight for quick switching
	+ Added celestial bodies as a target type
	+ Added tool tips for the vessel types, along with a count of that type
	+ When in map view, when body or the active vessel is selected, the map focuses on it. This works like Tab, in that it does not seem to cycle thru packed vessels
* 2013-1031: 0.0.2.2 (enamelizer) for KSP 0.22 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Release of Haystack 0.0.2.2 with compatibility for KSP 0.22.
